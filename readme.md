ReciPick is the first full app I have made that makes an AJAX call.

I built ReciPick by using the Mobil First approach.

The goal for this application is to allow the user to quickly pick what he/she wants to make instead of having to browse the internet.

Technology used- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.

I am in the process of making the selected icons animated in the screen.

Bellow is the wire frame and flow chart for the page along with some screenshots.
